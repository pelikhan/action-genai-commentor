# action action


## Docs!

This script generates and updates TypeScript function using an AST/LLM hybrid approach.
It uses ast-grep to look for undocumented and documented functions,
then uses a combination of LLM, and LLM-as-a-judge to generate and validate the documentation.

You should pretify your code before and after running this script to normalize the formatting.


## Inputs

- `instructions`: Additional prompting instructions for the LLM.
- `dry_run`: If true, the script will not modify files.
- `missing`: Generate missing docs. (default: `true`)
- `update`: Update existing docs.
- `max_files`: Maximum number of files to process. (default: `100`)
- `max_updates`: Maximum number of new or updated comments total. (default: `100`)
- `flex_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to build content of requests. (default: `12000`)
- `github_token`: GitHub token with `models: read` permission at least. (required)
- `debug`: Enable debug logging.

## Outputs

- `text`: The generated text output.
- `data`: The generated JSON data output, parsed and stringified.

## Usage

Add the following to your step in your workflow file:

```yaml
uses: pelikhan/action-genai-commentor@main
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Example

```yaml
name: My action
on:
    push:
permissions:
    contents: read
    # issues: write
    # pull-requests: write
    models: read
concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pelikhan/action-genai-commentor@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Development

This action was automatically generated by GenAIScript from the script metadata.
We recommend updating the script metadata instead of editing the action files directly.

- the action inputs are inferred from the script parameters
- the action outputs are inferred from the script output schema
- the action description is the script title
- the readme description is the script description
- the action branding is the script branding

To **regenerate** the action files (`action.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`), run:

```bash
npm run configure
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This will overwrite any changes you made to these files!

To lint script files, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To typecheck the scripts, run:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

To build the Docker image locally, run:
```bash
npm run docker:build
```

To run the action locally in Docker (build it first), use:
```bash
npm run docker:start
```

To run the action using [act](https://nektosact.com/), first install the act CLI:

```bash
npm run act:install
```

Then, you can run the action with:

```bash
npm run act
```

## Upgrade

The GenAIScript version is pinned in the `package.json` file. To upgrade it, run:

```bash
npm run upgrade
```

## Release

To release a new version of this action, run the release script on a clean working directory.

```bash
npm run release
```
